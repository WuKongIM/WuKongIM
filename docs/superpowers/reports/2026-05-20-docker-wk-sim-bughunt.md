# Docker WK-Sim Bughunt Report

Date: 2026-05-20
Branch: `qa/wk-sim-bughunt-20260520`
Worktree: `.worktrees/wk-sim-bughunt-20260520`

## Scope

- Exercise the Docker Compose three-node development cluster plus `wk-sim`.
- Use simulated traffic to find reproducible bugs and performance issues.
- For each confirmed product issue: reproduce, fix, verify, commit, and keep searching.

## Environment Notes

- The worktree lives under the repository `.worktrees` directory. The parent `go.work` at `/Users/tt/Desktop/work/go/WuKongIM-v2/go.work` selects the original `WuKongIM` module, so Go commands in this nested worktree must use `GOWORK=off`.

## Verification Log

| Time | Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-05-20 | `GOWORK=off go test ./...` | Pass | Full unit-test baseline passed in the isolated worktree. |
| 2026-05-20 | `docker compose --profile dev-sim config --quiet` | Pass | Compose configuration parsed successfully. |
| 2026-05-20 | reduced `scripts/dev-sim-compose-smoke.sh` | Pass | `WK_SIM_USERS=40`, `WK_SIM_RATE=0.5/s`, `WK_SIM_VERIFY_RECV=sampled`; transient recv errors observed during startup recovery. |
| 2026-05-20 | default `scripts/dev-sim-compose-smoke.sh --no-build` with `--timeout 180` | Pass | Reached `running` after about 107s, then emitted traffic. |
| 2026-05-20 | default `scripts/dev-sim-compose-smoke.sh --no-build --timeout 90 --skip-logs` | Fail | Timed out in `state=waiting` with `connected_users=0`, no last error, and no sent messages. |
| 2026-05-20 | `GOWORK=off go test ./scripts -run TestDevSimComposeSmokeDefaultTimeoutCoversHighTrafficStartup -count=1` | Red then pass | Regression test failed with the old 90s default and passed after increasing the default to 180s. |
| 2026-05-20 | `GOWORK=off go test ./scripts ./internal/bench/devsim -count=1` | Pass | Focused unit verification for the smoke script and dev-sim config package. |
| 2026-05-20 | default `scripts/dev-sim-compose-smoke.sh --no-build --skip-logs` | Pass | With the 180s default, fresh Compose startup reached traffic before timeout. Status still showed send errors, tracked separately as BUG-002. |

## Findings

| ID | Status | Area | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix Commit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BUG-001 | Fixed | Docker dev-sim smoke | Default smoke timeout is 90s, but the Compose profile starts 1000 users with inherited `connect_rate: 10/s`; the script times out in `state=waiting` before traffic starts. | Compose overrides workload size but not simulator connect rate, so connection setup alone needs roughly 100s before the first traffic window. | Pending commit |
| BUG-002 | Investigating | Docker dev-sim traffic | Default smoke can report pass while `/status` has non-zero `send_errors` after startup; recent node logs show `message.send.refresh.failed` with `context deadline exceeded`. | Unknown. Initial evidence points at cold-channel metadata activation under the default 250 msg/s ingress profile. | Pending |

## Active Test Matrix

- Compose smoke with reduced laptop-safe simulator load.
- Compose smoke with default dev-sim profile.
- Bounded stress pass with higher `WK_SIM_RATE` / `WK_SIM_TRAFFIC_CONCURRENCY`.
- Focused unit/e2e tests for every confirmed code defect.
