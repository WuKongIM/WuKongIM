# WuKongIM v3 Documentation Site

This directory contains the standalone [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev/)
application for the public WuKongIM v3 documentation. Phase 1 establishes the
bilingual site shell and complete menu plan; it intentionally does not migrate
the legacy page bodies.

## Develop

Requires Bun.

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The canonical local entry points are `/zh` and
`/en`.

## Validate

```bash
bun run verify
```

The verification suite checks the navigation contract, redirect seed, generated
menu plan, lint and TypeScript, static export, language-isolated search indexes,
and the exclusion of planned routes from sitemap and LLM outputs.

## Content lifecycle

- Edit the full bilingual plan in `lib/navigation.ts`.
- Run `bun run navigation:write` to update `NAVIGATION.md`.
- Add both `page.mdx` and `page.en.mdx` content variants before changing a menu
  entry from `planned` to `published`.
- Keep planned routes visible, but never include them in public indexes.
- Treat `redirects.json` as a non-exhaustive migration seed, not a deployment
  configuration.

See `FLOW.md` for the publishing flow and `PHASE_1_SPEC.md` for scope.
